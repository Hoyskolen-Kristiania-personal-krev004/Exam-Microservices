## Spring Cloud Eureka
I have chosen to utilize Spring Cloud Eureka instead of HashiCorp Consul for Service Discovery and Registry. I have elected to use Eureka, as it is easier to set up and integrate in Spring projects, and I find my current experience with Consul to be too insufficient to take advantage of the depth that it offers compared to other Service Discovery Tools.
